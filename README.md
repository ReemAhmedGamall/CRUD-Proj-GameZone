# GameZone

GameZone is a simple CRUD web application built during my internship to manage a catalog of games.  
Users can create, read, update, and delete game entries including name, category, supported devices, description, and a cover image. The project was implemented using **ASP.NET MVC** and **Bootstrap** for responsive UI.

The repo also includes a small weather-demo page that consumes the Open-Meteo API to show the **current weather** and **7-day forecast** for **Cairo** and **New York**.

## Tech Stack
- ASP.NET MVC (C#)
- SQL Server 
- Bootstrap (front-end styling)
- Open-Meteo API for weather data

## How to Run the Project
